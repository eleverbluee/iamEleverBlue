### Welcome to my profile! <hr>
My name is EleverBlue. I am a YouTuber, content creator, and a developer. I'm currently working for [LaunchFight](https://github.com/LaunchFight). LaunchFight used to be owned by me, which is now owned by [Auitenti](https://github.com/Auitenti), but I'm the leader of LaunchFight.

**Here's a list of things I can do**
- ðŸ“¹ I can video edit
- ðŸ–¥ I can work on Minecraft servers
- ðŸ“œ I can script on Roblox

I am **not** available for hire currently, as I'm currently working on LaunchFight, but maybe I might be available for hire soon.
